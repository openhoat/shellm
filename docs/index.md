## Why Termaid?

[Warp](https://www.warp.dev) is a great AI-powered terminal, but its AI features only work with proprietary cloud providers — there is no support for [Ollama](https://ollama.ai), which means no free, local, or self-hosted option.

Termaid was born out of that frustration: a fully open alternative that works with Ollama out of the box, keeping your data local and your wallet intact.

> This project was entirely built with AI — from architecture to code, tests, and documentation, using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) (Anthropic), [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), and [GLM](https://github.com/THUDM/GLM).
