# Markdown Formatting Rule

## Objective

Defines standard markdown formatting rules to ensure consistency across all markdown files in the project.

## Blank Lines Rule

**No unnecessary blank lines except the last one.**

When editing or creating markdown files:
- **Do not** add consecutive blank lines between paragraphs or sections
- **Do not** add blank lines at the end of a file (except ONE blank line at the very end)
- Use **exactly one blank line** between paragraphs or sections
- Use **exactly one blank line** after headings

### Examples

**Correct:**
```markdown
# Title

Content paragraph 1.

Content paragraph 2.

## Subtitle

More content.
```
```
Last line of content.

```

**Incorrect:**
```markdown
# Title


Content paragraph 1.


Content paragraph 2.


## Subtitle


More content.
```
```
Last line of content.


```

## Application

This rule applies to:
- All `.md` files in the project root
- All `.md` files in `.clauderules/` and `.clinerules/` directories
- All `.md` files in subdirectories (docs, etc.)

## Enforcement

When using the `Edit` or `Write` tools on markdown files:
- Ensure no consecutive blank lines are introduced
- Ensure exactly one blank line at the end of files
- Ensure proper spacing between sections and paragraphs
