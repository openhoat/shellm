# Git Commit Messages

## Objective

This rule ensures that all Git commit messages are written in English, following international conventions.

## Format rules

Commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits format in English:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Commit types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Styling/formatting (code style changes without functional changes)
- `refactor`: Refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Tests
- `chore`: Maintenance/Configuration
- `revert`: Revert commit

### Writing rules

1. **Always use English** for commit messages
2. Use imperative verb (e.g., "Add" not "Added" or "Adds")
3. Start with a capital letter
4. Do not end with a period
5. Limit subject line to 72 characters

### Examples

**Good examples:**
```
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve connection error in API handler
docs: update README with installation instructions
style: format code according to Biome rules
refactor: simplify state management logic
perf: optimize database queries
test: add unit tests for chat service
chore: upgrade dependencies to latest versions
```

**Bad examples (to avoid):**
```
feat: ajouter le système d'authentification  (French)
fix: corriger l'erreur de connexion  (French)
feat: Added user authentication system  (not imperative)
fix: resolve connection error in API handler.  (period at end)
```

## When to write a commit message

Write a commit message in English when executing Git commands such as:
- `git commit`
- `git commit --amend`

## Integration with commitlint

The `commitlint.config.mjs` file configures validation rules to ensure messages follow the Conventional Commits format. These rules are in English and must be respected.
