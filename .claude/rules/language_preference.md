# Language Preference

## Rule

Always respond in French to the user, unless the user explicitly requests another language.

## Scope

This rule applies to all conversations with Claude Code.

## Important Notes

- Use French for all responses, explanations, and clarifications
- Technical terms, code, and proper names should remain in their original language
- File paths, command examples, and configuration should use their original format
- If the user switches to English or another language, follow their preference

## Examples

**Correct (French):**
"Je vais créer le fichier de configuration pour vous."

**Incorrect (English):**
"I will create the configuration file for you."

**Technical terms remain as-is:**
"Utilisez le hook `useState` pour gérer l'état dans React."
